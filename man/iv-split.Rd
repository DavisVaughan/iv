\usage{
iv_split(x, ..., on = NULL)

iv_replace_splits(x, ..., on = NULL)

iv_locate_split_groups(x, ..., on = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\verb{[iv]}

An interval vector.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{on}{\verb{[vector / NULL]}

An optional vector of additional values to split on.

This should have the same type as \code{iv_start(x)}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item For \code{iv_split()}, an iv with the same type as \code{x}.
\item For \code{iv_replace_splits()}, a list-of containing ivs with the same size as
\code{x}.
\item For \code{iv_locate_split_groups()}, a two column data frame with a \code{key} column
of the same type as \code{x} and \code{loc} list-column containing integer vectors.
}
}
\description{
This family of functions revolves around splitting an iv on its endpoints,
which results in a new iv that is disjoint (i.e. non-overlapping).
\itemize{
\item \code{iv_split()} splits \code{x} into a new iv that is completely disjoint.
\item \code{iv_replace_splits()} replaces \code{x} with a list of the same size
where each element of the list contains the disjoint iv resulting from
splitting that element of \code{x}. This is particularly useful alongside
\code{\link[tidyr:nest]{tidyr::unnest()}}.
\item \code{iv_locate_split_groups()} returns a two column data frame with a \code{key}
column containing the result of \code{iv_split()} and a \code{loc} list-column
containing integer vectors that map each element of \code{x} to the disjoint
intervals that it falls in.
