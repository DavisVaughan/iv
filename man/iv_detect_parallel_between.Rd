\title{Detect when a vector falls between an iv in parallel}
\usage{
iv_detect_parallel_between(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{\verb{[vector, iv]}

\code{x} should be a vector and \code{y} should be an iv. \code{x} should have the same
type as the start/end components of \code{y}.

These will be recycled against each other.}
}
\value{
A logical vector the same size as the common size of \code{x} and \code{y}.
}
\description{
\code{iv_detect_parallel_between()} detects when \code{x}, a vector, falls between the
bounds of \code{y}, an iv, \emph{in parallel}, where parallel means that the i-th value
of \code{x} is compared against the i-th interval of \code{y}. This is in contrast to
\code{\link[=iv_detect_between]{iv_detect_between()}}, which works more like \link[base:match]{base::\%in\%}.

These functions return a logical vector the same size as the common size of
\code{x} and \code{y}.
